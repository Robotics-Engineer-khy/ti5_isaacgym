## Installation

1. Generate a new Python virtual environment with Python 3.8 using `conda create -n isaacgym python=3.8`,then `conda activate isaacgym`
2. For the best performance, we recommend using NVIDIA driver version 535 `sudo apt install nvidia-driver-535`. The minimal driver version supported is 515. If you're unable to install version 535, ensure that your system has at least version 515 to maintain basic functionality.
3. Install PyTorch 1.13 with Cuda-11.7:
   - `conda install pytorch==1.13.1 torchvision==0.14.1 torchaudio==0.13.1 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia`
4. Install numpy-1.23 with `conda install numpy=1.23`.
5. Install Isaac Gym:
   - Download and install Isaac Gym Preview 4 from https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym.
   - `cd isaacgym/python && pip install -e .`
   - Run an example with `cd examples && python 1080_balls_of_solitude.py`.
   - Consult `isaacgym/docs/index.html` for troubleshooting.
6. Install humanoid-gym:
   - Clone this repository.
   - `cd humanoid_gym && pip install -e .`

## Usage Guide

#### Examples

```bash
# Launching PPO Policy Training for 'ti5' Across 8192 Environments
# This command initiates the PPO algorithm-based training for the humanoid task.
python scripts/train.py --task=t1_dh_stand --run_name ti5 --headless --num_envs 8192

# Evaluating the Trained PPO Policy 'ti5'
# This command loads the 'ti5' policy for performance assessment in its environment. 
# Additionally, it automatically exports a JIT model, suitable for deployment purposes.
python scripts/play.py --task=t1_dh_stand --run_name ti5

# Implementing Simulation-to-Simulation Model Transformation
# This command facilitates a sim-to-sim transformation using exported 'ti5' policy.
python scripts/sim2sim.py --load_model /path/to/logs/t1_dh_stand/exported/policies/policy_1.pt

# Run our trained policy
python scripts/sim2sim.py --load_model /path/to/logs/t1_dh_stand/exported/policies/policy_example.pt

```

#### 1. Default Tasks


- **humanoid_ppo**
   - Purpose: Baseline, PPO policy, Multi-frame low-level control
   - Observation Space: Variable $(47 \times H)$ dimensions, where $H$ is the number of frames
   - $[O_{t-H} ... O_t]$
   - Privileged Information: $73$ dimensions

- **humanoid_dwl (coming soon)**

#### 2. PPO Policy
- **Training Command**: For training the PPO policy, execute:
  ```
  python humanoid/scripts/train.py --task=t1_dh_stand --load_run log_file_path --name run_name
  ```
- **Running a Trained Policy**: To deploy a trained PPO policy, use:
  ```
  python humanoid/scripts/play.py --task=t1_dh_stand --load_run log_file_path --name run_name
  ```
- By default, the latest model of the last run from the experiment folder is loaded. However, other run iterations/models can be selected by adjusting `load_run` and `checkpoint` in the training config.

#### 3. Sim-to-sim

- **Mujoco-based Sim2Sim Deployment**: Utilize Mujoco for executing simulation-to-simulation (sim2sim) deployments with the command below:
  ```
  python scripts/sim2sim.py --load_model /path/to/export/model.pt
  ```


#### 4. Parameters
- **CPU and GPU Usage**: To run simulations on the CPU, set both `--sim_device=cpu` and `--rl_device=cpu`. For GPU operations, specify `--sim_device=cuda:{0,1,2...}` and `--rl_device={0,1,2...}` accordingly. Please note that `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` is not applicable, and it's essential to match the `--sim_device` and `--rl_device` settings.
- **Headless Operation**: Include `--headless` for operations without rendering.
- **Rendering Control**: Press 'v' to toggle rendering during training.
- **Policy Location**: Trained policies are saved in `humanoid/logs/<experiment_name>/<date_time>_<run_name>/model_<iteration>.pt`.

#### 5. Command-Line Arguments
For RL training, please refer to `humanoid/utils/helpers.py#L161`.
For the sim-to-sim process, please refer to `humanoid/scripts/sim2sim.py#L169`.

## Code Structure

1. Every environment hinges on an `env` file (`legged_robot.py`) and a `configuration` file (`legged_robot_config.py`). The latter houses two classes: `LeggedRobotCfg` (encompassing all environmental parameters) and `LeggedRobotCfgPPO` (denoting all training parameters).
2. Both `env` and `config` classes use inheritance.
3. Non-zero reward scales specified in `cfg` contribute a function of the corresponding name to the sum-total reward.
4. Tasks must be registered with `task_registry.register(name, EnvClass, EnvConfig, TrainConfig)`. Registration may occur within `envs/__init__.py`, or outside of this repository.


## Add a new environment 

The base environment `legged_robot` constructs a rough terrain locomotion task. The corresponding configuration does not specify a robot asset (URDF/ MJCF) and no reward scales.

1. If you need to add a new environment, create a new folder in the `envs/` directory with a configuration file named `<your_env>_config.py`. The new configuration should inherit from existing environment configurations.
2. If proposing a new robot:
    - Insert the corresponding assets in the `resources/` folder.
    - In the `cfg` file, set the path to the asset, define body names, default_joint_positions, and PD gains. Specify the desired `train_cfg` and the environment's name (python class).
    - In the `train_cfg`, set the `experiment_name` and `run_name`.
3. If needed, create your environment in `<your_env>.py`. Inherit from existing environments, override desired functions and/or add your reward functions.
4. Register your environment in `humanoid/envs/__init__.py`.
5. Modify or tune other parameters in your `cfg` or `cfg_train` as per requirements. To remove the reward, set its scale to zero. Avoid modifying the parameters of other environments!
